    <b>Hi everyone!</b>
    </p>
    <p class="description">
        This site is an effort to integrate, develop and maintain the community of <b>Chaos Engineering in Colombia</b>. We are a group of people with diverse characteristics but linked by three common purposes: injecting failures, breaking applications and design resilience strategies. 
        <br />
        <br />

        This project does not have a goal ... We just do things for no other reason than to do them.
